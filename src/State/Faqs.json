            "qestion": "WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE CURRENT GAME, SPLITGATE?",
            "answer": "Splitgate is still available on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. You can download it, play it online, invite friends, and, we hope, have a great time. We will continue to support Splitgate with bug fixes and small updates for the foreseeable future. The servers will remain on and anyone can play, earn from the Beta Season 2 Battle Pass or take on our Infinite Battle Pass on September 15."

            "qestion": "IS SPLITGATE EVER COMING OUT OF BETA?",
            "answer": "Technically, yes. We will be removing the “beta” tag when our final season releases on September 15, but internally we are not considering this the big “World Wide Launch” we planned to celebrate."

            "qestion": "WHY STOP FEATURE DEVELOPMENT ON A GAME WITH AN ACTIVE COMMUNITY?",
            "answer": "It’s for the community that we’ve made the difficult decision to end feature development for Splitgate. We think we have something special. We know from our community that they believe in Splitgate. But we face a reality that we are trying to update, upgrade, and build for the future all at the same time. The best thing for the active community is to give them more people to play with and a game we feel is fully worthy of their fandom - every map, every skin, every moment of gameplay. To do that, we need to focus on the future of the Splitgate universe and deliver a game and a moment in time that no shooter fan will be able to ignore."

            "qestion": "WHAT HAPPENS TO MY ITEMS AND PROGRESSION?",
            "answer": "We can’t reveal much about our next game, but we are taking this opportunity to build something better than the original Splitgate. And that means characters, weapons, and the progression system are all going to evolve. Skins won’t be able to transfer in the same way that you can’t peel the paint off your old house and apply it to the mansion you moved into. We understand the time spent in acquiring these items. We want to reward your efforts and time in Splitgate and we take that seriously. How we will do that is not decided at this time, but know that it is something we are focused on as we discuss the next game."

            "qestion": "WHAT HAPPENS TO MY SPLITCOIN?",
            "answer": "Splitcoin can still be used in Splitgate and, in fact, the store will continue to update so you can attain cool items to enjoy. We have nothing we can say regarding Splitcoin carrying over or having value in our next game."
        },
        {
            "qestion": "WILL THERE STILL BE NEW CONTENT FOR SPLITGATE?",
            "answer": "Yes! We have a new Battle Pass coming September 15. It will be high-quality and feature multiple new characters… including our best female character to date. We will also continue to supply items for drops and maintain the Splitgate in-game store for the foreseeable future."
